PNT-CAT
================

This shiny application provides a simple user interface that provides
various options for delivering the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT; Roach
et al., 1996) in an item response theory framework (IRT). Research supporting this application has been funded by the National Institutes of Health - National Institute for Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIH-NIDCD) awarded to William Hula and Gerasimos Fergadiotis. The app was built and designed by Rob Cavanaugh, Alex Swiderski, Gerasimos Fergadiotis, and William Hula. 

While this is a browswer-based application, the application is open source and can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/aphasia-apps/pnt" target="_blank">on Github</a>. The application can further be installed locally and used without an internet connection. Please note that the app does not store any data beyond a single user-session. Refer to the github.com page for instructions for installation. Feedback and pull requests are welcome and encouraged.

**About us:**

[**Rob Cavanaugh, M.S., CCC-SLP**](https://robcavanaugh.com) is a speech-language pathologist and Ph.D candidate at the University of Pittsburgh. His research focuses on identifying and resolving implementation gaps in aphasia rehabilitation, improving patient access to evidence-based care, and enhancing treatment specification and effectiveness. He is also interested in statistics and data science, programming (R + python + js), data visualization, and science communication in communication sciences and disorders.

**Alex Swiderski M.S., CCC-SLP** is a speech-language pathologist and Ph.D candidate at the University of Pittsburgh. He feels that the University of Pittsburgh provides excellent mentorship in an environment that facilitates cross disciplinary training. Through his acceptance to the program, he has been able to collaborate and gain valuable training at not only the University of Pittsburgh, but also the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Center and Carnegie Mellon. 

[**Gerasimos Fergadiotis Ph.D**](https://psuaphasialab.wixsite.com/aald) is a Professor in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at Portland State University. Dr. Fergadiotis’ research, which is currently funded by NIDCD (1R01DC015999, 1R01DC018813), is focused on developing psychometric applications for quantifying cognitive/linguistic deficits in people with communication disorders. Specifically, the overarching goal of his research is to develop a computer adaptive test to assist professionals with the accurate diagnosis of word retrieval deficits in people with aphasia. He collaborates closely with a team of clinical researchers, psychometricians, and computer scientists from the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center and OHSU. He is also the director of the PSU Aphasia Lab.

**William Hula Ph.D CCC-SLP** is a speech pathologist in the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Audiology and Speech Pathology Service and Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center and an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Communication Science and Disorders. He is a graduate of the VA RR&D Research Career Development program and has active research projects funded by both VA RR&D and NIH/NIDCD. His research interests include measurement of language performance and patient-reported functioning in aphasia, the application of latent trait measurement models to aphasia assessment, aphasia treatment, and brain-behavior relationships in language and aphasia.
